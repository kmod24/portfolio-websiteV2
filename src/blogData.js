     During my Spring semester of college, I decided to go abroad and do an exchange program in Osaka, Japan. Many thoughts filled
     my head -- I would be going alone, I wasn't the best at speaking Japanese, and I would pretty much be on my own figuring things
     out.

    But it turns out I was completely wrong. As soon I landed in Kansai International Airport, I was greeted by kind Japanese
    workers and began to take in the reality that would be mine for the next 5 months.


    <p class="section-title">MARCH:</p>
    It was cold. I made a few friends in the dorm, and grew closer with other CSULB students that were also doing the exchange
    program with me. It was my second time in Japan, but this time I would be living as an actual resident here. The dorm started
    off as quiet -- other foreign students were settling in and the ice was slowly starting to thaw. I had my own room in a 6 person 
    unit; and although it was quite small, it was still nice and cozy considering it was my first time dorming ever.

    I met a bunch of friends from around the world -- Switzerland, Netherlands, South Korea, and even some exchange student
    friends from USA. We all connected very quickly, and we traveled together during the month of March and
    explored Japan as a group. We went to out first Izakayas, went to Tokyo and embarked on huge
    shopping sprees, and prepared for the cherry blossoms which was almost in full bloom. Our school
    semester would start in April, so we tried our best to spend our time as much as we could and explore Japan before all of us 
    would be occupied with school.

    <p class="section-title">APRIL:</p>
    April was full of memories and friendships began to bloom with the cherry blossoms. After our first trip to Tokyo,
    we quickly headed back to Ibaraki, Osaka and slowly prepared for our upcoming semester. I would occasionally go
    to Dotonbori and even shop at the big malls for clothes. Me and Weibo began our rock climbing journey, and although
    I was hesitant at first, I can confidently say that it has definitely been one of the best experiences so far. I slowly began to adjust
    myself to a new lifestyle; I always rode my bike back and forth to and from campus, and there were days where I would
    go straight to Kyoto after school was over.

      My Japanese began to improve, and I felt comfortable holding conversations with Japanese people. School wasn't
      stressful, and I would spend most of my time at the FamilyMart by the dorm trying new drinks and snacks. Life
      was good, and it all still felt surreal to me. The Japanese people at our rock climbing gym taught me many
      techniques that had helped me improve, and I even learned Kansai-ben (Osaka Slang) from them.

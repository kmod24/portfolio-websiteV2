     During my Spring semester of college, I decided to go abroad and do an exchange program in Osaka, Japan. Many thoughts filled
     my head -- I would be going alone, I wasn't the best at speaking Japanese, and I would pretty much be on my own figuring things
     out.

    But it turns out I was completely wrong. As soon I landed in Kansai International Airport, I was greeted by kind Japanese
    workers and began to take in the reality that would be mine for the next 5 months.


    <p class="section-title">MARCH:</p>
    It was cold. I made a few friends in the dorm, and grew closer with other CSULB students that were also doing the exchange
    program with me. It was my second time in Japan, but this time I would be living as an actual resident here. The dorm started
    off as quiet -- other foreign students were settling in and the ice was slowly starting to thaw. I had my own room in a 6 person 
    unit; and although it was quite small, it was still nice and cozy considering it was my first time dorming ever.

    I met a bunch of friends from around the world -- Switzerland, Netherlands, South Korea, and even some exchange student
    friends from USA. We all connected very quickly, and we traveled together during the month of March and
    explored Japan as a group. We went to out first Izakayas, went to Tokyo and embarked on huge
    shopping sprees, and prepared for the cherry blossoms which was almost in full bloom. Our school
    semester would start in April, so we tried our best to spend our time as much as we could and explore Japan before all of us 
    would be occupied with school.
